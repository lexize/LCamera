## LCamera
Cinematic camera avatar for Figura.

Uses [LUtils](https://github.com/lexize/lutils) 1.1 (that still unreleased but who cares anyway).

You can see controls in Figura menu.

TODO:
* Path save/load
* Avatar commands like `lc$offset`, `lc$metadata`, and etc.

Thats all, i guess. Explore my shitcode, if you want to.
